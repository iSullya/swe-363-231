        <p>The Clever Dripper is a mix between a French Press and a Pour-over coffee maker, </p>
        <p>  bringing the best out of the two extraction methods; immersion and filter. </p> 
        <p>   Its shape is reminiscent of the pour-over coffee maker but uses the  </p>
        <p>   immersion method thanks to a special valve placed at the bottom.  </p>
